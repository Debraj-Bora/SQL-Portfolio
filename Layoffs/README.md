# Dataset Details
This dataset is from the [Layoffs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022/data) by Swapnil Tripathi. It entails the tech layoffs from March 11,2020(when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic, to June 2, 2024.

## Project Overview
I prepared the [raw dataset](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Layoffs/layoffs.csv) through standard cleaning processes, and analyzed the resulting data to identify trends and create insights from it. My main goal was to understand the impact of COVID-19 and the distribution of layoffs across the tech industry.

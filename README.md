# SQL-Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my SQL projects, showcasing my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project includes detailed SQL scripts and explanations to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

## Projects
+ Project: Tech Layoffs
  - Description: This project involves cleaning and transforming [raw layoff data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022/data), and analyzing the layoff data. The goal is to understand the impact and distribution of layoffs across different tech sectors during COVID-19.
  - SQL Skill Used: Table Creation, Data Insertion, Removing Duplicates, Data Type Conversion, Common Table Expressions(CTEs), String Manipulation, Window Functions, Aggregations, Group By, Joins, Date Functions.

+ Project: Bank Loan Case Study
  - Description: This project involves cleaning and transforming [raw bank loan data](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Loan%20Case%20Study/financial_loan.csv), and analyzing the loan data. The goal is to understand the KPIs that determines a loan application to be bad or good.

+ Project: Bikestore Sales Analysis
  - Description: In this project, we extracted and transformed data from multiple tables to create a final structured dataset for analysis. Using SQL, we joined customer, order, product, store, and sales staff tables to consolidate key metrics such as total units sold and revenue. The data was then aggregated to optimize performance for visualization in Tableau, enabling insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional distribution. The script for creating tables can be found [here](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Bike-Store-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/BikeStores%20Sample%20Database%20-%20create%20objects.sql), and the data [here](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Bike-Store-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/BikeStores%20Sample%20Database%20-%20load%20data.sql).
  - SQL Skills Used: Data Extraction, Joins, Aggregations, Group By, String Manipulation, Data Filtering.

+ Project: Coffee Sales Analysis
  - Description: This project involves cleaning and transforming [raw coffee shop sales data](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Coffee%20Shop%20Sales.csv), to prepare it for further analysis. The dataset includes information such as sales, products, transaction date and store location.
